## Profile

I have worked with PHP for more than 10 years, using frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Zend Framework and in-house frameworks and libraries. I am currently working with Java (Quarkus). I am looking for an opportunity to build something awesome, to learn, share knowledge and grow together.

I strive to build reliable software that is tested, manteinable and easy to understand.
